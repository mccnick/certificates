 ## Nick McCullough - Software Engineering Certifications

Welcome! This page is for all of my Software Engineering Certificates through Forage. I found out about Forage through JPMorgan Chase recruiting. After completing my inital JPMorgan Chase certification, I saw multiple companies offering professional certification. These certifications take a few hours but offer real-world software engineering virtual experiences. They are free to students and offered by the respective companies through Forage.

I take these certifications from companies I respect and would ultimately work for, in addition to increasing my knowledge of software engineering best practices. Please take a look below and see for yourself. Where available, I have added links to the pull requests to see my work. Thanks! -Nick

  --> For this certification, I studied and analyzed security of provided organization passwords using hashing algorithms (MD5, SHA-256, etc) and offered improvements to make the passwords more secure such as MFA, Salt Hashing, Account locking, and more complex password policies.
